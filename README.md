- **Ready to go**: Built-in components and pages that give you a headstart and reduce setup time
- **Quick to configure**: Site config (`config/site.ts`) to configure the app in one place with minimal effort
- **Easy to theme**: Play around with different colors and fonts to adjust the branding and style of the app
